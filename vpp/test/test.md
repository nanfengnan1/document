## vpp unittest tutorials

### 1. introduce

The goal of the VPP Test Framework is to ease writing, running and debugging unit tests for the VPP. For this, python was chosen as a high level language allowing rapid development with scapy providing the necessary tool for creating and dissecting packets.

It implemnts the most of unittest function for vpp by using vnet/pg.

```bash
# compile and run a unittest case
make test TEST=test_dns

# unittest debugging for [releaseå’Œdebug]
# release
make test-start-vpp-in-gdb DEBUG=core TEST=test_dns
make test DEBUG=attach TEST=test_dns

# debug
make test-start-vpp-debug-in-gdb DEBUG=core TEST=test_dns
make test DEBUG=attach TEST=test_dns
